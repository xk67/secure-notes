# Development

Development Infrastructure and Workflow

## CI/CD

- Automatic dependency updates and security alerts using GitHub Dependabot

**Github Actions**

- Project security analysis with Snyk
- Frontend testing with Selenium
- Backend testing with the Django test framework
- Build the application as a Docker image and publish it to the GitHub Container Registry on pushes to main or on releases

## IDE

- At the beginning, I used Codium with Vim and Python extensions
- Later, I switched to Zed to try speeding up my workflow with an integrated LLM chat and better keyboard shortcut customization

## Git Workflow

The project is hosted on GitHub, and development is done using a feature-branch workflow based on relevant issues.

## HTTP Request Testing

ZAP was used to manipulate and analyze HTTP requests, for example for XSS testing and general traffic inspection.
